Choice Reaching Task Simulations with Dynamic Field Theory

This simulation uses COSIVINA framework which allows to build dynamic neural field structures in MATLAB. 
All structures are need to be added as an element in order to be used in the Simulation. 
Some elements were modified considering our needs in the simulations. 
These elements were renamed with "Modified" prefix (e.g. ModifiedImageLoader). 
You can find the original element fiels and the modified ones in the "elements" folder.
